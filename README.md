# 📈 Explainable Stock Recommendation System

AI-Powered Investment Intelligence for Personalized & Transparent Stock Selection

This project delivers an end-to-end machine-learning-driven stock recommendation system built using forecasting models, hybrid recommendation algorithms, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard. Designed to be explainable, robust, and production-ready, it analyzes 60+ NSE-listed stocks using fundamentals, technical indicators, user profiling, and risk-adjusted prediction models.

# 🚀 Features

<b>📊 Forecasting models</b>: ARIMA, ARIMA-GARCH, LSTM, LSTM-GARCH, and reliability-weighted ensembles

<b>🧩 Hybrid recommender system</b>: Content-based + Collaborative filtering + Risk profiling

🧠 Explainable ML with performance charts, radar plots, volatility-return visualizations

<b>🧍 User profiling</b>: risk appetite + sector preferences

<b>📉 Deep financial metrics</b>: volatility, Sharpe ratio, CAGR, profit margins, ROE/ROA etc.

🌐 Interactive Streamlit App to generate personalized recommendations

# 📊 Data Pipeline

1. Data Collection

60+ NSE stocks from sectors like IT, Banking, Pharma, Energy, FMCG

Live price + fundamentals fetched using Yahoo Finance API

2. Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Backfill for missing values

Daily returns, volatility, CAGR, mean returns

Sharpe ratio & advanced statistical transformations

Fundamentals integrated:

marketCap, ROE, ROA, profitMargins, governance risk scores

3. Encoding & Scaling

OneHotEncoding for sector/industry/region

MinMaxScaler for numerical features

👤 User Profiling
Risk Appetite (Real-world Investor Distribution)
Profile	% Users	Behavior
Conservative	40%	Prefers stable, low-volatility stocks
Balanced	40%	Medium-risk diversified picks
Aggressive	20%	High volatility & high growth
Sector Preferences

Each simulated user chooses 2 sectors → Helps generate realistic investment patterns.

Investment Probability Logic

Base probability: 0.2

Sector match bonus: +0.1

Risk-adjusted boost based on volatility & CAGR

Final matrix: 1000×58 synthetic user-stock investments

🤖 Forecasting Models
Models Used

ARIMA / ARIMA-GARCH for autocorrelation + volatility

LSTM / LSTM-GARCH for nonlinear temporal patterns

Ensemble Forecasting via reliability-weighted averaging

Model Selection Metric: Reliability Score
score = 0.3*(1/RMSE) +
        0.2*(1/MAPE) +
        0.4*(CI Coverage) +
        0.1*(Residual Std)


Best model per stock selected based on highest score.

🔍 Recommendation Engine Architecture
1. Content-Based Filtering

Similarity via fundamentals + performance metrics.

2. Collaborative Filtering

User–user patterns based on synthetic 1000×58 investment matrix.

3. Risk-Adjusted Ranking

Uses profile-specific prediction formulas:

Conservative
```
Pred_Score = (0.5*Pred_Signal + 0.35*Lower_Return + 0.15*Upper_Return) * (1 - Volatility)
```
Balanced
```
Pred_Score = (0.5*Pred_Signal + 0.25*Lower_Return + 0.25*Upper_Return) * (1 - |Volatility - 0.5|)
```

Aggressive
```
Pred_Score = (0.5*Pred_Signal + 0.15*Lower_Return + 0.35*Upper_Return) * Volatility
```

4. Hybrid Ranking

Final list = Merge candidates → Score → Top-k picks

❄️ Cold-Start Solutions
New Users

If user has no investment history → rank based on risk profile.

New Stocks

Use feature similarity (content-based filtering).

🖥️ Streamlit Interface (Explainable AI)

The dashboard includes:

✅ User Inputs

Select portfolio

Choose risk appetite

Generate recommendations

📈 Explainability Tabs

Performance (historical line chart)

Radar Chart (multi-metric comparison)

Feature Similarity Heatmap

Volatility vs CAGR Scatter

This gives users transparent reasoning behind every recommendation.
